# QFastInteger

This repository is the work of Cade Brown, Gregory Croisdale, and Rebecca Ryan. It aims to explore a few different useful computations aimed at integers and their applications.

It includes RSA encryption/decryption/cracking, Lucas-Lehmer (LL) primality testing for Mersenne primes, faster FFT-based integer multiplication, and Shor's Quantum integer factorization algorithm.

All the source code is included as jupyter notebooks
